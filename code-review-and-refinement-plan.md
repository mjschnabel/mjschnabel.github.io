# Code Review and Refinement Plan

Before starting on my enhancements to the projects, I went through a completed a thorouogh code review on the existing code for all of the projects. During this code review I scrutinized things like design of the code, code styling and variable and function naming. I also investigated how to improve the code could be improved from a functionality perspective. I looked at things like if there were any logical errors that could lead to bugs or security issues, as well if the program worked as intended.

I recorded this code review and the full video can be seen here:
